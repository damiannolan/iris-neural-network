    "\n",
    "Artifical Neural Networks are quickly becoming one of the most popular and widely used mechanisms in Machine Learning and Data Analysis. In the last number of years, numerous libraries and software has been developed to equip programmers with a set of tools for modeling and analysing data in order to recognise patterns and make predictions using large data sets. In today's age of [Big Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) it is important to try make sense of all of the data we have in society. This could range from social media pattern recognitions from anything to finance and economic trends. The reality is that today we have more data in existence than ever before and it growing at a vast and exponential rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artifical Neural Networks aim to mimic and replicate the neurons of a human brain and using the power of the complex mathematical functions allow us to process and model data in such a way that we can form rational assumptions on a given data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sheer amount of data out there it is important to note that data we may analyse is often subject to human error and may not always hold a valid essense of truth. For the purpose of this example we will take a look at the [Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). \n",
    "\n",
    "More information on the data set can be found on the link provided above or on the front page [README of this repository](https://github.com/damiannolan/iris-neural-network).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook we aim to build an Artifical Neural Network capable of making predictions of species of Iris Flowers using [Keras](https://keras.io) - Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",

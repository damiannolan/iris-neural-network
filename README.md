# Iris Data Set - Keras Neural Network

## Emerging Technologies - Problem Sheet 4

This respository contains solutions to a set of problems concerning neural networks using Tensorflow. For the purpose of
this example we apply the *Iris* data set previously used in another problem set you can you find
[HERE!](https://github.com/damiannolan/iris-data-set)

Previously in the repository linked above we looked at loading the *Iris* csv data with Python and inspecting it using
[Matplotlib's Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html). We then investigated how to determine the best
fit line for the data set and various subsets using [Numpy's
polyfit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) and by also writing our own gradient descent algorithm. We took a brief look a Scatterplot matrices using a relatively new library called [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).


## Iris Data Set

The data set contains samples of 3 different types of *Iris* plant.

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The data samples contain 50 samples for each of the different types of species. Each sample is composed of 4 distinct
features of the plants including:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The original Problem Set can be found [HERE!](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/tensorflow.html)

All of the Python code relating to the Problem Set linked above can be found in the juptyer notebook housed in this
repository, which also contains some markdown cells relevant to the tasks being carried out.
